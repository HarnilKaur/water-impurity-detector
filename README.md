# 💧 Water Impurity Detector (ESP32-based)

A low-cost, sensor-based system to detect and analyze water impurities using **ESP32** and **IR sensors**.  
The device measures light absorption and scattering caused by impurities in water and provides real-time monitoring of impurity levels.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Water Impurity Detector** is built using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, an **IR LED**, and a **photodiode**.  
When IR light passes through a water sample, impurities affect its transmission. The photodiode detects these variations, which are then processed by the ESP32 to estimate impurity levels.  

This project demonstrates how **optical sensing techniques** can be applied in water quality monitoring.
